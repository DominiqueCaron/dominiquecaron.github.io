    title: "About Me"

    content: |-
      I am currently working for Canadian Forest Service at the Pacific Forestry Center. As a member of the [Predictive Ecology](https://predictiveecology.org/) team, I am implement ecological models based on the [PERFICT](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14034) principles. The objective is to integrate vegetation, disturbance, and carbon budget models to better understand how future conditions will influence the Canadian boreal forest.

      I recently completed my PhD at McGill University under the supervision of [Dr. Laura Pollock](https://qbiodiversity.org/). My research focused on trait-based modeling of species interactions and food webs (see [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.13966) and [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.13807)) and the seasonal movements of birds (in revision).

      Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with Éco-corridors laurentiens and the federal government to design and implement tools that support data-driven decision-making. To know more about my research and previous experiences, please feel free to explore my [CV](/cv/Caron_CV.pdf) and [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c1ee-V4AAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=ao).

          I worked as a term employee and as a independent contractor with the Environmental emergency team. I developped, updated, and enhanced a [R shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/) used to quickly retrieve, summarize, and visualize ecological data. This tool is used to help decision-making during environmental emergencies in Eastern Canada.

          In collaboration with Ouranos, Health Canada, and the National Institute of Public Health, I aimed quantify the consequences of climate change for the health of outdoor workers in Canada. I provided predictions on the evolution of heat-stress estimates in 2050 from climate models. Many tools I developped during this work were also added to the package [ClimateTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaClimate/ClimateTools.jl) for Julia.
